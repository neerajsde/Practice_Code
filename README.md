## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of code snippets and implementations related to data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand basic concepts or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, you may find useful examples and explanations here.

## Languages

The implementations are provided in the following programming languages:

- C++
- Java
- Python
- Git

Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages!

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the programming language. Each language directory contains subdirectories for different topics, such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, linked lists, trees, etc.


## How to Use

You can explore the code and learn from the implementations. If you want to contribute or improve existing implementations, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-feature`.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's fixing a bug, improving an existing implementation, or adding a new algorithm, feel free to contribute. Please follow the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
